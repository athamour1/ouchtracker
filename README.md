# OuchTracker — Injury & Kit Tracker

A full-stack web application for managing first-aid kits across an organisation. Admins configure kits and users; checkers inspect kits, record incidents, and track item stock in real time.

## Features

### Admin
- **Kit management** — create, edit, delete kits with name, location, and description
- **Multi-assignee** — assign one or more checker users to each kit
- **Item management** — add, edit, delete items per kit (name, category, unit, quantity, expiry date, location in kit, notes)
- **CSV import** — bulk-import kit items from a CSV file
- **BoM PDF export** — export a beautifully formatted Bill of Materials PDF per kit, including item table grouped by category, expiry status colour-coding, kit QR code, and summary stats — ready to print and insert into the physical kit
- **QR codes** — generate and download a QR code per kit that links directly to the kit landing page
- **User management** — create/manage admin and checker accounts
- **Incident reports** — view all incident reports across kits with expandable detail and vertical scroll
- **Inspection history** — view all inspection logs across kits with expandable detail and inspector notes
- **Dashboard** — summary widgets (total kits, items, expiring soon, already expired) + items needing attention panel
- **Kit filter** — filter inspection and incident logs by kit

### Checker
- **Assigned kits** — see only kits assigned to them
- **Kit inspection** — search and filter items, step through each item, record quantity found and notes, submit an inspection log
- **Incident report** — search kit items, select items used, record quantities and paragraph notes per item, submit a report (automatically deducts stock)
- **My history** — view own inspection and incident report history (identical layout to admin tables)
- **Dashboard** — personal summary of assigned kits, expired and expiring items

### General
- **Role-based access control** — JWT-authenticated, `ADMIN` / `CHECKER` roles enforced on every endpoint
- **Dark mode** — full dark-mode support toggled from the header and login page, preference persisted in `localStorage`
- **Expiry tracking** — items flagged as expired or expiring within 30 days with colour-coded indicators
- **Responsive UI** — works on desktop and mobile; drawer starts closed on mobile
- **Offline-first PWA** — fully installable; all pages and API data are pre-cached on first load and refreshed in the background; checkers can complete inspections and file incident reports with no connection, submissions queue locally and auto-sync when back online; admins can browse kits and users in read-only mode offline
- **Rounded UI** — consistent rounded buttons, inputs, cards, dialogs, banners and notifications throughout
- **Stay logged in** — optional "stay logged in" toggle on login; issues a long-lived refresh token (bcrypt-hashed, stored in DB), rotated on every use
- **Skeleton loading** — Quasar skeleton placeholders on all list/table views while data loads
- **Internationalisation (i18n)** — full English and Greek (Ελληνικά) translations via vue-i18n v9; language selection saved to the user's profile in the database and restored on login
- **Profile settings** — users can update their name, email, password, and display language from a dedicated profile page

## Progressive Web App

OuchTracker is a fully offline-capable installable PWA:

- **Installable** — "Add to Home Screen" / install prompt shown automatically
- **Full offline support** — on first authenticated load the app silently pre-warms the Workbox cache for all kits (including item details), users, inspection/incident history, and dashboard data; the pre-warm repeats whenever the device comes back online or the tab becomes visible again
- **Offline submissions** — checkers can complete inspections and file incident reports with no connection; submissions are queued to `localStorage` (`ouchtracker_sync_queue`) and flushed automatically on reconnect with a success/failure notification
- **Deep-link navigation offline** — `navigateFallback: /index.html` ensures any route (e.g. `/my-kits/abc/inspect`) loads correctly from the service worker even on a cold start
- **Caching strategy per endpoint:**
  - `/api/kits`, `/api/users` → `StaleWhileRevalidate`, 24 h
  - `/api/alerts` → `NetworkFirst`, 4 s timeout, 5 min
  - `/api/inspections`, `/api/incidents` → `NetworkFirst`, 4 s timeout, 1 h
- **Auto-update** — `skipWaiting + clientsClaim`; users are prompted to reload when a new build ships
- **Theme** — `theme_color: #b14d4d` applied to browser chrome and mobile status bar

The production nginx config serves `sw.js` with `no-store` so the browser always fetches the latest service worker, while all other static assets get a 1-year immutable cache.

## Data Model (summary)

```
User ──< KitAssignees >── Kit ──< KitItem
                           │         │
                           │         └──< InspectionLogItem >── InspectionLog >── User
                           │         └──< IncidentReportItem >── IncidentReport >── User
                           └──< InspectionLog
                           └──< IncidentReport
```

- **User** — `ADMIN` or `CHECKER`, many-to-many with kits
- **Kit** — physical first-aid kit box/bag at a location
- **KitItem** — item in a kit (no global catalog; items are kit-specific)
- **InspectionLog** — one record per inspection session with per-item snapshots
- **IncidentReport** — records items consumed during an incident, deducts stock

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose v2+

### Development

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

| Service  | URL                        |
|----------|----------------------------|
| Frontend | http://localhost:9000       |
| Backend  | http://localhost:3000/api  |
| Postgres | localhost:5432             |

The backend runs in watch mode (hot-reload). The frontend runs Quasar's PWA dev server (`quasar dev -m pwa`) with HMR — the service worker is active in dev too.

**Default admin credentials** (seeded on first start):

| Field    | Value                  |
|----------|------------------------|
| Email    | `admin@ouchtracker.local`   |
| Password | `Admin1234!`           |

Override via environment variables before starting:
```bash
SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com \
SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourPassword1! \
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

### Production

Pre-built images are published to GitHub Container Registry by `release.sh`:
- `ghcr.io/athamour1/ouchtracker/backend`
- `ghcr.io/athamour1/ouchtracker/frontend`

1. Copy the example env file and fill in secrets:
   ```bash
   cp .env.prod.example .env.prod
   # edit .env.prod
   ```

2. Pull and start (uses the `latest` tag by default):
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d
   ```

3. To deploy a specific release:
   ```bash
   IMAGE_TAG=v1.2.0 docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d
   ```

The app is available on port **80**. Nginx serves the Quasar PWA (built with `quasar build -m pwa`) and proxies `/api` to the NestJS backend. The service worker (`sw.js`) is served with `no-store` headers so updates are picked up immediately. The database port is not exposed publicly.

#### Releasing a new version

```bash
./release.sh
```

The script will:
1. Prompt for a semver version (e.g. `1.2.0`)
2. Bump the version in `frontend/package.json` and create a `chore(release): bump version` commit
3. Build and push `backend` and `frontend` Docker images to GHCR (tagged `:vX.Y.Z` and `:latest`)
4. Create an annotated Git tag and a GitHub release with auto-generated notes

#### Required `.env.prod` variables

```env
DB_USER=ouchtracker
DB_PASSWORD=change_me
DB_NAME=ouchtracker_db

JWT_SECRET=change_me_to_a_long_random_string
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=8h

CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com
API_URL=/api

SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@your-domain.com
SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD=StrongPassword1!
SEED_ADMIN_NAME=System Admin

# Optional: pin to a specific release tag (default: latest)
IMAGE_TAG=latest
```

## CSV Import Format

Kit items can be imported via **Admin → Kit Detail → Import CSV**. The file must have the following columns (header row required):

```csv
name,category,unit,quantity,expirationDate,locationInKit,notes
Surgical Mask,PPE,pcs,50,2026-12-31,Front Pocket,
Bandage 10cm,Wound Care,roll,10,,Main Compartment,Check stock monthly
```

| Column | Required | Format |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `name` | Yes | Text |
| `category` | No | Text |
| `unit` | No | Text (default: `pcs`) |
| `quantity` | No | Integer (default: `0`) |
| `expirationDate` | No | `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `locationInKit` | No | Text |
| `notes` | No | Text |

## QR Code Workflow

1. Admin opens **Kits** page and clicks the QR icon on any kit row.
2. A dialog shows the QR code for that kit's landing page URL.
3. The QR can be downloaded as a PNG and printed/attached to the kit.
4. Scanning the QR opens the **Kit Landing Page** (authentication required), which shows three action buttons:
   - **Incident Report** — record items used in an incident
   - **Kit Contents** — view / edit the kit's item list
   - **Start Inspection** — begin a checklist inspection
